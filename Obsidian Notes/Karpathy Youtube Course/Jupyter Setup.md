Got kernel stuff set up. 

Need pip packages working.
'/home/deck/.local/bin'
Installing collected packages: numpy
  WARNING: The script f2py is installed in '/home/deck/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.

Working kernel is miniconda 3.11.5.  I think my terminal isn't using that version of python maybe so not installing packages for the right version?
Resolved the issue by installing Anaconda python distribution, targeted at Data  Science
